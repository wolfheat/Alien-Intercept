* IDEAS
- Space shooter autoscroller.


16/7	* Starting with simple prototype
		* Player movement working with damping/maxvelocity
		* Enemies spawn at keypress but unanimate
		* Player can shoot
17/2	* Added particle effects for enemies and bullets destroyed
		* Changed to HDR Pipeline
		* Added some lightening effects, darkened background highligt units

		and having 11 slots where the animation can origin from the top
		this makes it possible to move the enemys animation path by changing its parent.
18/2	* Created a level design system for creating waves of enemies with scriptable objects 
		and points that can be placed on the scene and their pos gives Xpos creation and time
		* Added separate menu music and transition.
		* Made ghost ship use a reference for what weapon its use
28/2	* Added Generic Pooling system for bullets and Rockets
		* Stores around 95 bullets each for player and ghost, and 8 rockets
		* Added a few soundeffects
