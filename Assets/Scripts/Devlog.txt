13-23 Feb 2023


* IDEAS
- Space shooter autoscroller.


16/7	* Starting with simple prototype
		* Player movement working with damping/maxvelocity
		* Enemies spawn at keypress but unanimate
		* Player can shoot
17/2	* Added particle effects for enemies and bullets destroyed
		* Changed to HDR Pipeline
		* Added some lightening effects, darkened background highligt units
		* Decided on a solution for the enemy creation. Using animation
		and having 12 slots where the animation can origin from the top
		this makes it possible to move the enemys animation path by changing its parent.
18/2	* Created a level design system for creating waves of enemies with scriptable objects 
		and points that can be placed on the scene and their pos gives Xpos creation and time
		* Added separate menu music and transition.
		* Made ghost ship use a reference for what weapon its use
28/2	* Added Generic Pooling system for bullets and Rockets
		* Stores around 95 bullets each for player and ghost, and 8 rockets
		* Added a few soundeffects
1/3		* Added Crosshair that the player moves towards instead of teleporting to.		
		* Added Getting Hit effect that flashes player as white for a brief time.
		* Added simple Pause Screen overlay UI
2/3		* Added option to stop shooting, currently using X
		* Created option to create Waves of enemies in the Level editor.
		* Created First Boss, added special SO for bosses and made looping animation for it
3/3		* Added UI HUD text that shows remaining spawn points and active enemies.
8/3		* Changed to having the parent of all points move instead of each point.
		* Fixed issue where coroutines kept running when restarting.
		* Updated so Boss have more health and adjustable in the SO
10/3	* Transition now stops the game and hinders new enemies from spawning. 
		* There is a fading effect and the enemies on screen are killed off one by one for a nice effect.
